		  <h3>About Us</h3>
		  <p>
		  Ned N. had deep roots in agriculture, having grown up on a small dairy farm in Illinois. His father died of cancer at age 42, leaving Ned, the
eleventh of thirteen children, with his mother and the dairy farm, which provided an environment of rich memories, especially those formed in working with
animals. After completing his Ph.D. in psychology, Ned, his wife, and ten children, sought to preserve the fond memories of an
agricultural environment, especially that portion involved in working with animals.
Ned, Jr., the fourth of ten children of Ned N. and Virginia, obtained his master's degree and worked for several years outside of the ranch. However, his main
aspirations were focused in agriculture. Consequently in 1976, Ned N. and Ned A. pursued, aggressively, the development of a viable ranch business. With the
benefits of good luck and some hard work, the ranch grew from four sections, with approximately 100 animals to its current size with capacity for 4,000 animal units.
This commitment to growth has been sustained with profits generated by the ranch. The profit margin in ranching is very low, in many cases, nonexistent. Operating
a ranch for profit, combined with a commitment to growth, presents a daunting challenge. We do not shrink from this; we welcome it.
The commitment to continued growth requires a staff of special people. We are fortunate to have a core staff of exceptional people, including the managing
partners, office manager, cow foreman and operations manager. Continued profitability and growth is directly linked to our team.
In order to nurture and expand the pool of employees, we have been hosting an intern program. This provides us with an opportunity to supply
training opportunities for college students, enabling them to build their portfolio. It also provides the ranch with an opportunity for a potential labor pool. In
the long run, it is our expectation that some of the interns will find the ranch experience rewarding and join our team.

			<p>
Harmonious:
We believe the enterprise must reflect a balance between economic reality, proper use of renewable resources, providing opportunity and satisfaction for people
involved in it, and adaptability to continuously changing business circumstances.
Honest:
We believe the enterprise must be honest in the sense that it is self maintaining. Inputs and outputs are balanced. Growth is continuous and sustainable and the
products generated are necessary and attractive in the marketplace.
Efficient:
We believe the enterprise must be efficient in so far as it reflects wise use of natural resources, neither exploiting nor wasting human potential, raw materials
or financial resources.</p>

The ranch is primarily a cow/calf operation. This means that we convert grass to protein and, hopefully, sell it at a profit. Our current stocking rate requires
continued vigilance to maintain and improve quality and attempts to continue our expansion by treating the resources, mainly grass, in a husband-like manner. We
are fortunate to be located a short distance from two of the premier purebred Angus breeders in the world, Stevenson Genetics and Basin Angus Ranch. We have
purchased bulls from these ranches for the past 20 years. We have enrolled our entire calf crop in the Angus Source program for multiple years.
The physical facilities of the ranch consist of over 100 sections, including deeded and leased land. The core of the ranch is in one contiguous block. We lease
summer pasture as it becomes available.
The ranch is adjacent to a highway, approximately 20 miles north of Roundup. There are five houses on the ranch providing living arrangements for key personnel,
plus one house devoted exclusively to support of our intern program. There is approximately one mile of creek bottom, providing excellent wintering facilities for
calves, as well as some irrigated hay.</p>
